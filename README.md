# scrape 

In this assignment, we are going to create an app
that would scrape a websites articles, display the 
article on our page. We could then save the article or 
delete it from our saved articles, and we could also
add notes and/ or delete the notes.

here is a list of the following steps 
1 - scrape articles from any chosen website
2 - save the article in our database
3 - display everything in our HTML
4 - generate buttons that will save/delete the article
5 - generate buttons that will add/ delete notes

I was able to scrape a website, also add a note.
but I am currently working on the rest.
